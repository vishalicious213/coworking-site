# We Barely Work (Co-Working Site)

This was a Scrimba project. The co-working site project focused on CSS concepts to build and style a website that showcased three coworking spaces. It delved into constructing layouts with CSS Flexbox and other techniques that made use of `margin: auto` on flex children and `position: absolute`, `position: relative` and `position: fixed`. `align-self` was also utilized to control the placement of card elements.
