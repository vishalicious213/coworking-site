# We Barely Work (Co-Working Site)

This was a Scrimba project. The co-working site project focused on CSS concepts to build and style a website that showcased three coworking spaces. It delved into constructing layouts with CSS Flexbox and other techniques that made use of `margin: auto` on flex children and `position: absolute`, `position: relative` and `position: fixed`. `align-self` was also utilized to control the placement of card elements.

I expanded on this project using JavaScript to add functionality to the burger menu icon so that it worked and then created three variations of the coworking space site with different themes (fantasy, horror & sci-fi). These variations presented additional "coworking spaces" that were thematically appropriate to their given page.
